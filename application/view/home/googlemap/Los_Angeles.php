   A.   Purpose. It is the purpose of the “RMP” Mobilehome Park Zone to encourage the provision of affordable housing in the City as provided in the Housing Element of the General Plan, by permitting both the retention and expansion of existing mobilehome parks and the establishment of new mobilehome parks. It is also the purpose of this ordinance to encourage the maintenance of the property for residential uses by allowing land zoned RMP to be used for single family dwellings. Because of the usual location of these lots in areas with industrial and manufacturing uses, the preservation of the property for single family residential use may require the variation from some of the standard housing requirements necessary or desirable in the rest of the City. Accordingly, the large lot minimum yard area requirements are necessary to ensure compatibility between single family residential uses and possible surrounding nonresidential uses.
 
   B.   Use.  No building, structure or land shall be used and no building or structure shall be erected, moved onto the site, structurally altered, enlarged or maintained, except for such uses as may be permitted therein:
 
   1.   Mobilehome parks.
 
   2.   One-family dwellings.
 
   3.   Parks, playgrounds or community centers, owned and operated by a governmental agency.
 
   4.   Truck gardening; the keeping of equines, poultry, rabbits and chinchillas, in conjunction with the residential use of the lot, provided that such animal keeping is not for commercial purposes.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,188, Eff. 7/18/10.)

No person shall store equipment including, but not limited to, trailers or trucks in excess of one ton or wheeled construction equipment on property zoned for residential purposes.
 
   (10)   Deliveries and pickups are limited to two per day for all of the home occupations carried on in the dwelling, and only to services which normally make deliveries to or pickups from households in residential areas.

   (1)   Definitions.  As used in this subparagraph the term “Superintendent” means the Superintendent of the Department of Building and Safety.  The term “Department” means the Department of Building and Safety.
 
   (2)   Order to Comply.  For any home occupation found to be in violation of Section 12.05A16(a) of this Code, the Superintendent shall send an Order to Comply to the operator of the home occupation use.  The Order to Comply shall clearly state the following:
 
   (i)   The violation must be corrected by a Compliance Date specified in the Order, which date shall be no more than 15 days from the date the Order is mailed.
 
   (ii)   Failure to correct the violation on or before the Compliance Date may result in the imposition of an administrative fine in the amount of $250.00.
 
   (3)   Reinspection.  The Superintendent shall reinspect a property for which an Order to Comply was issued pursuant to this paragraph subsequent to the Compliance Date.
 
   (4)   Failure to Correct Violation.  If any violation specified in the Order to Comply is not corrected prior to the Compliance Date as specified in the Order to Comply, an administrative fine of $250.00 may be collected by the Department.
 
   If  the Department determines that a fine is due, then it shall notify the person cited by United States mail in a sealed envelope, with postage paid.  If the person cited is the owner of the property, the notice shall be addressed to the last known address of the owner as that address appears in the last equalized assessment roll. If the person to be cited is a tenant, the notice shall be addressed to the location where the home occupation is being conducted. Service of the notice shall be deemed to have been completed at the time of deposit with the United States Postal Service.
 
   The person cited shall remit the fine to the Department within 30 days after the date of mailing of the notice.  If the person cited fails to do so, then the Department, by sending a second notification by certified mail, may demand payment of the fine from the person cited and may prohibit the issuance of any building permit, license or approval to the cited persons until such fees are paid.
 
   (5)   Repeated Violations.

Three violations of any condition set forth in Section 12.05 A.16.(a) of this Code which has resulted in an Order to Comply being issued under Paragraph (d)(2) may result in the imposition of proceedings to discontinue the home occupation use.  The Director shall have jurisdiction to discontinue a home occupation use by giving notice to the record owner of the home occupation by issuing A Notice of Intention to Discontinue the Home Occupation (Notice).  The Notice shall provide an opportunity for the home occupation user to either

   (3)   All such signs abutting a major or secondary highway or a googlemap street shall be placed clear of the ultimate street dedication line determined in accordance with the current Standard Street Dimensions adopted by the City Planning Commission.
 
   (4)   Where the sign area has been previously determined and the lot frontage subsequently altered either by sale, division of land, or other means, a new determination based on the new lot frontages must be made by the Department of City Planning for allowable sign areas in accordance with the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any existing signs which are in excess of the size limitations contained in this section may be maintained, provided that the owner or owners of record of all lots whose frontages were included in the original frontage, record in the office of the County Recorder a covenant or covenants, running with the land, in which said owner or owners agree to erect no new signs until the existing signs which are in excess of the size limitations contained in this section have been removed or are made to conform to said size limitations. A copy of said recorded covenant or covenants shall be filed with the Department of Building and Safety by said owner or owners. Further, if said covenant or covenants are not recorded, any existing signs which are in excess of the size limitations contained in this section must be removed or made to conform to said size limitations within six months of the date on which the frontage was altered. In addition, the applicant shall advise the Superintendent of Building and Safety in writing within six months that the existing signs which are in excess of the size limitations have been removed.
